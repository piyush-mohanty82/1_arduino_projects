# Ultrasonic Distance Measurement Project

This project demonstrates how to measure the distance to an object using an ultrasonic sensor and an Arduino. The sensor sends out a ping and measures the time it takes for the echo to return. This time is then used to calculate the distance to the object.

# Components Needed

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).

Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04).

<u>Jumper wires.<u>

Breadboard.
