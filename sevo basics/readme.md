# Servo Motor Control with Serial Input

This Arduino project allows you to control the position of a servo motor through serial input. The user can input an angle value via the serial monitor, and the servo will move to that angle.

# Components Needed

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).

Servo motor.

Jumper wires.

Breadboard (optional).

# Circuit Diagram

Connect the components as follows:

Servo Motor:

Signal pin to digital pin 9 on the Arduino.

Power pin to +5V (VCC).

Ground pin to GND.
