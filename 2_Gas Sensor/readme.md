# Gas Sensor Alert System

This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino to monitor gas levels using a gas sensor and trigger alerts using LEDs and a buzzer when gas levels exceed a certain threshold. This system can be useful for detecting dangerous levels of gases in the environment and providing timely alerts to ensure safety.

# Components Needed

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).

Gas sensor (e.g., MQ-2).

Red LED.

Green LED.

Buzzer.

Resistors (220Î© recommended for LEDs).

Jumper wires.

Breadboard.
