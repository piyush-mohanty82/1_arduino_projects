# Toggle LED with Push Button

This Arduino project demonstrates how to toggle an LED on and off with each press of a push button. The button state is read and compared to its previous state to detect button presses.

# Components Needed

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).

LED.

Push button.

Resistor (10k ohms, if not using the internal pull-up).

Jumper wires.

Breadboard (optional).

# Circuit Diagram.

Connect the components as follows:

LED:

Cathode (short leg) to ground.

Anode (long leg) to digital pin 8 through a current-limiting resistor (if necessary).

Push Button:

One leg to +5V (VCC).

The other leg to digital pin 12.

(Optional) A pull-down resistor (10k ohms) between the button pin and ground if not using the internal pull-up.
