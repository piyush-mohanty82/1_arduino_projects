# LED Brightness Control with Dual Push Buttons

This Arduino project demonstrates how to control the brightness of an LED using two push buttons. One button increases the brightness, while the other decreases it.

# Components Needed

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).

LED.

2 Push buttons.

Resistors (10k ohms, if not using the internal pull-up).

Jumper wires.

Breadboard (optional).

# Circuit Diagram.

Connect the components as follows:

LED:

Cathode (short leg) to ground.

Anode (long leg) to digital pin 3 through a current-limiting resistor (if necessary).

Push Buttons:

One leg of each button to +5V (VCC).

The other leg of the first button to digital pin 12.

The other leg of the second button to digital pin 11.

(Optional) Pull-down resistors (10k ohms) between the button pins and ground if not using the internal pull-up.
